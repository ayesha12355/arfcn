## Features

- **Easy Calculation**: Quickly convert between ARFCN and frequency values.
- **Multi-Network Support**: Supports 3GPP, LTE, and NR standards.
- **JavaScript and TypeScript**: Built using modern JavaScript and TypeScript for seamless integration.
- **NPM Package**: Available for easy installation via npm.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples for easy use.

## Installation

To get started with ARFCN, you can install the package via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install arfcn
```

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/ayesha12355/arfcn/releases) section.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the ARFCN tools in your JavaScript or TypeScript projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
const arfcn = require('arfcn');

// Convert ARFCN to frequency
const frequency = arfcn.toFrequency(100);
console.log(`Frequency for ARFCN 100: ${frequency} MHz`);

// Convert frequency to ARFCN
const arfcnNumber = arfcn.toArfcn(1800);
console.log(`ARFCN for 1800 MHz: ${arfcnNumber}`);
```
